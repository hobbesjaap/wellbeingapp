# Privacy Statement

- As can be seen by inspecting the source code, the app contains no tracking features or advertisement systems of ANY kind. I am not interested in your data.
- Any data entered into the app (your name, birthdate, etc) is stored locally on your device.
- The only internet connectivity that the app employs is to check for app updates online (by checking the file version_stuff.csv here on GitHub). If you're not online, the check fails, simple as that. The code for this function will only trigger if you press the "Check for Updates" button. It can be inspected in start_menu.gd

Too often "free" apps make you their product. Or are free with a hefty subscription lurking around the corner. I get it, for some people, such apps are their livelihood. For me, it's something I wish to develop and hope other people find useful. There is no monetary gain here. Of course I'm curious to see who uses the app. That's why I offer the option to subscribe to a newsletter, which is different. It's opt-in privacy-by-design stuff. You don't want to sign up? Don't press the button. It's really that simple. :)
